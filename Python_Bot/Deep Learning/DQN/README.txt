This Folder contains all modules that realizes the so called:
    Deep Q Network (Double, Dueling,...)
This is the simplest algorithm for Deep Reinforcement Learning, but 
the condition for this is to have dicrete actions for the agent.

This is doable for a simple Algorithm that will put all its portfolio inside one crypto.
It would certainly need continuous actions in case of having many cryptos inside one portfolio.
