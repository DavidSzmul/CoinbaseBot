This project consists in creating a library in order to easily study the cryptocurrencies on Coinbase in order to train a Bot to determine h24/7d what is the best crypto
to invest on.

## Extraction of Cryptocurrency historic
Use of Scrapping + Dataframe (Python) to generate the database used for train/test

## Training of Bot
Use of Reinforcement Learning principle -> Agent + Environment. Implementation of environment specifically for trading, whatever the number of trade studied


Use of Coinbase API + Scrapping + IA to create an homemade Bot to optimize portfolio of crypto. 

Different topics/issues are related to this project

**REST:** to get past historic of cryptos from Api's<br />
**Scrapping:** to get Real-Time values of cryptos AND convert automatically cryptos (Coinbase REST API does not implement conversion which induces higher fees)<br />
**Deep supervised Learning:** for prediction using LSTM<br />
**Deep reinforcement Learning:** for optimal decision<br />

- The chosen algorithm for the extraction of the partition is a flood-fill algorithm (homemade)
- This enables to avoid doublons of occurences of notes

## ðŸŽ¸ Regeneration of the music

- Based on the partition and the power of each note, it is possible to regerate the music.
- You can hear the difference in the example in the App:
        between  `lac_des_cygnes_original.wav` and `lac_des_cygnes_encoded.wav`
