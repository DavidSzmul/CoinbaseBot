TensorBoard is one of the best tools for visualizing the training stats of your deep learning models. We all anxiously check it hoping for decreasing loss functions and fast training time. I like to have TensorBoard running on my phone so I can check it on the go. It’s very simple to set up and can give you a boost of adrenaline as you monitor your training accuracy at the gym.
All you need to do is download a package called ngrok which will expose a local port over a secure tunnel to a public internet address. We can use this to tunnel TensorBoard’s port 6006 to a phone, computer, or any internet connected device.
First, download and install ngrok from https://ngrok.com/download.
Next, with TensorBoard launched on your local machine, start an ngrok session on the port TensorBoard is running on with the command:
ngrok http 6006
You should now see a new ngrok session running in your terminal which looks like this:
Go to the web address created by ngrok on your desired device to access your TensorBoard session.
